UM binaries for COMP 40

The file umbin.zip contains the following binaries:

  * File cat.um copies standard input to standard output. Try, for example

      echo Hello, world. | ./um cat.um

  * File hello.um prints a traditional message.
  * File midmark.um is a mid-size benchmark which when run prints the
    following:

     == UM beginning stress test / benchmark.. ==
    4.   12345678.09abcdef
    3.   6d58165c.2948d58d
    2.   0f63b9ed.1d9c4076
    1.   8dba0fc0.64af8685
    0.   583e02ae.490775c0
    Benchmark complete.

    On a well-optimized Universal Machine, this program runs in about one
    second. If yours takes much longer, it is probably OK.
  * File sandmark.umz is a self-decompressing benchmark which when run produces
    file sandmark.out. It should run in under a minute.
  * File advent.umz is a rather unsatisfying text adventure game. Don't forget
    to switch your goggles!
  * File codex.umz is a mysterious codex; even on an optimized Universal
    Machine it may take 30 seconds or more to launch. But once you get it
    working you'll be rewarded: your Universal Machine will boot a simple
    operating system, and if you are a bit of a hacker, you'll find a series of
    puzzles of increasing difficulty. Don't get too distracted; this stuff is
    pure entertainment.

If you choose the wrong abstractions, your performance could easily be off by a
factor of 100 or even 1000. Don't worry; this will not affect your grade?but it
will be frustrating, so you will want to make an effort to choose good
abstractions.

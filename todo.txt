Look into:
	Table_get (um:table.c)
	Table_put (um:table.c)
	Table_remove (um:table.c)

Possible changes:

noticed get32u is being called alot. All that it contains is a return, so to increase speed, instead of calling get32u, just call what that function is returning.
	in bitpack32.c. however it will stil make the same number of calls to bitpackget_u
		instead of having it call get32u, just return the return value?



Cannot change?: 
	
	getSeg:
		is already super short, 2 if statements with one line of code inand a return. 

	getReg: 
		super short. only one if and a return.
	setReg: 
		only one if and a return
